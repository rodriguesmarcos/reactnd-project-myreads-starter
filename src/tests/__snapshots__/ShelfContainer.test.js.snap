Half…and half. One half is cash. The other is a deed. Do you understand?” The town of Castle Rock, Maine has seen its fair share of oddities over the years, but nothing is a peculiar as the little curio shop that’s just opened for business. Its mysterious proprietor, Leland Gaunt, seems to have something for everyone out on display at Needful Things…interesting items that run the gamut from worthless to priceless. Nothing has a price tag in this place, but everything is certainly for sale. The heart’s desire for any resident of Castle Rock can easily be found among the curiosities…in exchange for a little money and—at the specific request of Leland Gaunt—a whole lot of menace against their fellow neighbors. Everyone in town seems willing to make a deal at Needful Things, but the devil is in the details. And no one takes heed of the little sign handing on the wall: Caveat emptor. In other words, let the buyer beware…",

        "description": "React ist ein JavaScript-Framework zur Entwicklung von Benutzeroberflächen sowohl im Browser als auch auf Mobilgeräten. Entwickelt und eingesetzt von Facebook ist es mittlerweile als Open-Source-Projekt verfügbar und hat sich bereits im Einsatz bei diversen namhaften Websites, wie z. B. Airbnb und Netflix, bewährt. Dieses Buch stellt Ihnen die Konzepte von React, React Router und Redux anhand eines durchgehenden Beispiels vor. Sie lernen, wie Sie mit React wiederverwendbare UI-Komponenten entwickeln und wie Sie auf Basis der einzelnen Komponenten ganze Anwendungen zusammenbauen. Unter anderem werden folgende Themen behandelt: - Entwickeln und Testen eigener React-Komponenten auf Basis des JavaScript-Standards ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) - Routing mit dem React Router - Das Architektur-Modell Flux und wie damit komplette Anwendungen umgesetzt werden (am Beispiel des Redux-Frameworks) - Serverseitiges Rendern von React-Komponenten und -Anwendungen - Anbindung eines REST-Backends Die im Buch eingesetzten Sprachfeatures aus ES6 werden in einem eigenen Kapitel vorgestellt, sodass zum Verständnis des Buches Kenntnisse von ES5 ausreichen. Nach der Lektüre des Buches werden Sie in der Lage sein, eigene Projekte mit React umzusetzen.",

        "description": "Satirical TV has become mandatory viewing for citizens wishing to make sense of the bizarre contemporary state of political life. Shifts in industry economics and audience tastes have re-made television comedy, once considered a wasteland of escapist humor, into what is arguably the most popular source of political critique. From fake news and pundit shows to animated sitcoms and mash-up videos, satire has become an important avenue for processing politics in informative and entertaining ways, and satire TV is now its own thriving, viable television genre. Satire TV examines what happens when comedy becomes political, and politics become funny. A series of original essays focus on a range of programs, from The Daily Show to South Park, Da Ali G Show to The Colbert Report, The Boondocks to Saturday Night Live, Lil’ Bush to Chappelle’s Show, along with Internet D.I.Y. satire and essays on British and Canadian satire. They all offer insights into what today’s class of satire tells us about the current state of politics, of television, of citizenship, all the while suggesting what satire adds to the political realm that news and documentaries cannot.",

After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office. Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, thelegendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man. You may think you know detectives, but you\'ve never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you\'ve never seen them under an investigation like this. Introducing Cormoran Strike, this is the acclaimed first crime novel by J.K. Rowling, writing under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.",

        "description": "You\'ve experienced the shiny, point-and-click surface of your Linux computer—now dive below and explore its depths with the power of the command line. The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you\'ll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book\'s short, easily-digestible chapters, you\'ll learn how to: * Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks * Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management * Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines * Edit files with Vi, the world’s most popular text editor * Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks * Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial \"shell shock,\" you\'ll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer. Just don\'t be surprised if your mouse starts to gather dust. A featured resource in the Linux Foundation\'s \"Evolution of a SysAdmin\"",

Half…and half. One half is cash. The other is a deed. Do you understand?” The town of Castle Rock, Maine has seen its fair share of oddities over the years, but nothing is a peculiar as the little curio shop that’s just opened for business. Its mysterious proprietor, Leland Gaunt, seems to have something for everyone out on display at Needful Things…interesting items that run the gamut from worthless to priceless. Nothing has a price tag in this place, but everything is certainly for sale. The heart’s desire for any resident of Castle Rock can easily be found among the curiosities…in exchange for a little money and—at the specific request of Leland Gaunt—a whole lot of menace against their fellow neighbors. Everyone in town seems willing to make a deal at Needful Things, but the devil is in the details. And no one takes heed of the little sign handing on the wall: Caveat emptor. In other words, let the buyer beware…",

Entwickelt und eingesetzt von Facebook ist es mittlerweile als Open-Source-Projekt verfügbar und hat sich bereits im Einsatz bei diversen namhaften Websites, wie z. B. Airbnb und Netflix, bewährt. Dieses Buch stellt Ihnen die Konzepte von React, React Router und Redux anhand eines durchgehenden Beispiels vor. Sie lernen, wie Sie mit React wiederverwendbare UI-Komponenten entwickeln und wie Sie auf Basis der einzelnen Komponenten ganze Anwendungen zusammenbauen. Unter anderem werden folgende Themen behandelt: - Entwickeln und Testen eigener React-Komponenten auf Basis des JavaScript-Standards ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) - Routing mit dem React Router - Das Architektur-Modell Flux und wie damit komplette Anwendungen umgesetzt werden (am Beispiel des Redux-Frameworks) - Serverseitiges Rendern von React-Komponenten und -Anwendungen - Anbindung eines REST-Backends Die im Buch eingesetzten Sprachfeatures aus ES6 werden in einem eigenen Kapitel vorgestellt, sodass zum Verständnis des Buches Kenntnisse von ES5 ausreichen. Nach der Lektüre des Buches werden Sie in der Lage sein, eigene Projekte mit React umzusetzen.",

        "description": "Satirical TV has become mandatory viewing for citizens wishing to make sense of the bizarre contemporary state of political life. Shifts in industry economics and audience tastes have re-made television comedy, once considered a wasteland of escapist humor, into what is arguably the most popular source of political critique. From fake news and pundit shows to animated sitcoms and mash-up videos, satire has become an important avenue for processing politics in informative and entertaining ways, and satire TV is now its own thriving, viable television genre. Satire TV examines what happens when comedy becomes political, and politics become funny. A series of original essays focus on a range of programs, from The Daily Show to South Park, Da Ali G Show to The Colbert Report, The Boondocks to Saturday Night Live, Lil’ Bush to Chappelle’s Show, along with Internet D.I.Y. satire and essays on British and Canadian satire. They all offer insights into what today’s class of satire tells us about the current state of politics, of television, of citizenship, all the while suggesting what satire adds to the political realm that news and documentaries cannot.",

After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office. Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, thelegendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man. You may think you know detectives, but you\'ve never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you\'ve never seen them under an investigation like this. Introducing Cormoran Strike, this is the acclaimed first crime novel by J.K. Rowling, writing under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.",

The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you\'ll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book\'s short, easily-digestible chapters, you\'ll learn how to: * Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks * Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management * Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines * Edit files with Vi, the world’s most popular text editor * Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks * Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial \"shell shock,\" you\'ll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer. Just don\'t be surprised if your mouse starts to gather dust. A featured resource in the Linux Foundation\'s \"Evolution of a SysAdmin\"",

Half…and half. One half is cash. The other is a deed. Do you understand?” The town of Castle Rock, Maine has seen its fair share of oddities over the years, but nothing is a peculiar as the little curio shop that’s just opened for business. Its mysterious proprietor, Leland Gaunt, seems to have something for everyone out on display at Needful Things…interesting items that run the gamut from worthless to priceless. Nothing has a price tag in this place, but everything is certainly for sale. The heart’s desire for any resident of Castle Rock can easily be found among the curiosities…in exchange for a little money and—at the specific request of Leland Gaunt—a whole lot of menace against their fellow neighbors. Everyone in town seems willing to make a deal at Needful Things, but the devil is in the details. And no one takes heed of the little sign handing on the wall: Caveat emptor. In other words, let the buyer beware…",

        "description": "React ist ein JavaScript-Framework zur Entwicklung von Benutzeroberflächen sowohl im Browser als auch auf Mobilgeräten. Entwickelt und eingesetzt von Facebook ist es mittlerweile als Open-Source-Projekt verfügbar und hat sich bereits im Einsatz bei diversen namhaften Websites, wie z. B. Airbnb und Netflix, bewährt. Dieses Buch stellt Ihnen die Konzepte von React, React Router und Redux anhand eines durchgehenden Beispiels vor. Sie lernen, wie Sie mit React wiederverwendbare UI-Komponenten entwickeln und wie Sie auf Basis der einzelnen Komponenten ganze Anwendungen zusammenbauen. Unter anderem werden folgende Themen behandelt: - Entwickeln und Testen eigener React-Komponenten auf Basis des JavaScript-Standards ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) - Routing mit dem React Router - Das Architektur-Modell Flux und wie damit komplette Anwendungen umgesetzt werden (am Beispiel des Redux-Frameworks) - Serverseitiges Rendern von React-Komponenten und -Anwendungen - Anbindung eines REST-Backends Die im Buch eingesetzten Sprachfeatures aus ES6 werden in einem eigenen Kapitel vorgestellt, sodass zum Verständnis des Buches Kenntnisse von ES5 ausreichen. Nach der Lektüre des Buches werden Sie in der Lage sein, eigene Projekte mit React umzusetzen.",

        "description": "Satirical TV has become mandatory viewing for citizens wishing to make sense of the bizarre contemporary state of political life. Shifts in industry economics and audience tastes have re-made television comedy, once considered a wasteland of escapist humor, into what is arguably the most popular source of political critique. From fake news and pundit shows to animated sitcoms and mash-up videos, satire has become an important avenue for processing politics in informative and entertaining ways, and satire TV is now its own thriving, viable television genre. Satire TV examines what happens when comedy becomes political, and politics become funny. A series of original essays focus on a range of programs, from The Daily Show to South Park, Da Ali G Show to The Colbert Report, The Boondocks to Saturday Night Live, Lil’ Bush to Chappelle’s Show, along with Internet D.I.Y. satire and essays on British and Canadian satire. They all offer insights into what today’s class of satire tells us about the current state of politics, of television, of citizenship, all the while suggesting what satire adds to the political realm that news and documentaries cannot.",

After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office. Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, thelegendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man. You may think you know detectives, but you\'ve never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you\'ve never seen them under an investigation like this. Introducing Cormoran Strike, this is the acclaimed first crime novel by J.K. Rowling, writing under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.",

The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you\'ll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book\'s short, easily-digestible chapters, you\'ll learn how to: * Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks * Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management * Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines * Edit files with Vi, the world’s most popular text editor * Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks * Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial \"shell shock,\" you\'ll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer. Just don\'t be surprised if your mouse starts to gather dust. A featured resource in the Linux Foundation\'s \"Evolution of a SysAdmin\"",

Half…and half. One half is cash. The other is a deed. Do you understand?” The town of Castle Rock, Maine has seen its fair share of oddities over the years, but nothing is a peculiar as the little curio shop that’s just opened for business. Its mysterious proprietor, Leland Gaunt, seems to have something for everyone out on display at Needful Things…interesting items that run the gamut from worthless to priceless. Nothing has a price tag in this place, but everything is certainly for sale. The heart’s desire for any resident of Castle Rock can easily be found among the curiosities…in exchange for a little money and—at the specific request of Leland Gaunt—a whole lot of menace against their fellow neighbors. Everyone in town seems willing to make a deal at Needful Things, but the devil is in the details. And no one takes heed of the little sign handing on the wall: Caveat emptor. In other words, let the buyer beware…",

Entwickelt und eingesetzt von Facebook ist es mittlerweile als Open-Source-Projekt verfügbar und hat sich bereits im Einsatz bei diversen namhaften Websites, wie z. B. Airbnb und Netflix, bewährt. Dieses Buch stellt Ihnen die Konzepte von React, React Router und Redux anhand eines durchgehenden Beispiels vor. Sie lernen, wie Sie mit React wiederverwendbare UI-Komponenten entwickeln und wie Sie auf Basis der einzelnen Komponenten ganze Anwendungen zusammenbauen. Unter anderem werden folgende Themen behandelt: - Entwickeln und Testen eigener React-Komponenten auf Basis des JavaScript-Standards ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) - Routing mit dem React Router - Das Architektur-Modell Flux und wie damit komplette Anwendungen umgesetzt werden (am Beispiel des Redux-Frameworks) - Serverseitiges Rendern von React-Komponenten und -Anwendungen - Anbindung eines REST-Backends Die im Buch eingesetzten Sprachfeatures aus ES6 werden in einem eigenen Kapitel vorgestellt, sodass zum Verständnis des Buches Kenntnisse von ES5 ausreichen. Nach der Lektüre des Buches werden Sie in der Lage sein, eigene Projekte mit React umzusetzen.",

        "description": "Satirical TV has become mandatory viewing for citizens wishing to make sense of the bizarre contemporary state of political life. Shifts in industry economics and audience tastes have re-made television comedy, once considered a wasteland of escapist humor, into what is arguably the most popular source of political critique. From fake news and pundit shows to animated sitcoms and mash-up videos, satire has become an important avenue for processing politics in informative and entertaining ways, and satire TV is now its own thriving, viable television genre. Satire TV examines what happens when comedy becomes political, and politics become funny. A series of original essays focus on a range of programs, from The Daily Show to South Park, Da Ali G Show to The Colbert Report, The Boondocks to Saturday Night Live, Lil’ Bush to Chappelle’s Show, along with Internet D.I.Y. satire and essays on British and Canadian satire. They all offer insights into what today’s class of satire tells us about the current state of politics, of television, of citizenship, all the while suggesting what satire adds to the political realm that news and documentaries cannot.",

After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office. Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, thelegendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man. You may think you know detectives, but you\'ve never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you\'ve never seen them under an investigation like this. Introducing Cormoran Strike, this is the acclaimed first crime novel by J.K. Rowling, writing under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.",

        "description": "You\'ve experienced the shiny, point-and-click surface of your Linux computer—now dive below and explore its depths with the power of the command line. The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you\'ll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book\'s short, easily-digestible chapters, you\'ll learn how to: * Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks * Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management * Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines * Edit files with Vi, the world’s most popular text editor * Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks * Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial \"shell shock,\" you\'ll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer. Just don\'t be surprised if your mouse starts to gather dust. A featured resource in the Linux Foundation\'s \"Evolution of a SysAdmin\"",
